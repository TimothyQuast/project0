# Project 0

My project0 webpage is 4 simple pages with a navbar at the top of every page
that can move to any other page. It is basically about myself because I like
talking about myself. Here's a description of each file:

index.html - the homepage; lists each of the pages on the website and describes
  them.
about.html - provides a few facts about me in list form.
picture.html - contains a picture of me.
table.html - contains a table of my favorite Bible verses!
TQ headshot 2015.jpg - a headshot of me from 2015 that is referenced by
  picture.html. You can't see, but I was wearing goofy shorts in the picture.
sass/styles.scss - the scss file which meets all of the project requirements.
styles/styles.css - the css file generated by sass. I used
  "sass --watch sass:styles" to watch the scss file and stay organized!
